- About Sulphurologist
👋 Hi, I’m @Sulphurologist. A Belgian geologist who has been oggling at fantasy maps his entire life.
This account is to dedicate my enthousiasm to mapping: both for fantasy projects, as for fleshing our Europa Universalis V's world map.
- I am a geologist by education, but instead of doubling down on a single topic I have become a jack-of-all trades, master of none, having several years of experience in following disciplines:
- (micro)paleontology (3+ yrs),
- sedimentology (3+ yrs),
- soil science (2+ yrs),
- geoarchaeology (4+ yrs),
- GIS (6+ yrs),
- Quaternary geology and Geomorphology (5+ yrs),
- Hydrogeology (1+ yrs).
