- What is Anbennar
Anbennar is the biggest and most ambitious High Fantasy world building project for the Paradox gaming universe, with the emphasis on Europa Universalis IV.
It is a world dear to my heart, as the vibrant world has come to fruition by its driven community that is eager to integrate all creative ideas.
This is my contribution to that world.

- What is this project about?
Atlas Anbennaris aims to centralise all geo-related world building information in a single repository.
Not only that, it will also expand upon the base lore already present, enhanced with heightmaps, climate maps, GIS-repositories and so forth.
- The archive contains the GIS project itself.
- All lore and world-building metadata will be available in the documents.

- Scope
I intend to update this project once every 1-2 months.
The end-goal: an actual browsable atlas, as if you were to buy one at the store.

- About Sulphurologist
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sulphurologist. A Belgian geologist who has been oggling at fantasy maps his entire life.
Anbennar is a world dear to my heart, as it's community driven that welcomes all creative ideas to create a most vibrant world.
- I am a geologist by education, but instead of doubling down on a single topic I have become a jack-of-all trades, master of none, having several years of experience in following disciplines:
- (micro)paleontology (3+ yrs),
- sedimentology (3+ yrs),
- soil science (2+ yrs),
- geoarchaeology (4+ yrs),
- GIS (6+ yrs),
- Quaternary geology and Geomorphology (5+ yrs),
- Hydrogeology (1+ yrs).
